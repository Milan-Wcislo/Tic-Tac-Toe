# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game can be played between two players, with each player taking turns to mark an empty space on the board. The game continues until one player wins or the board is full.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
2. Each player takes turns entering a number between 1 and 9 to mark an empty space on the board.
3. The game displays the current state of the board after each move.
4. The game checks for a winning position after each move. If a player gets three consecutive marks (either "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, they win the game.
5. The game continues until one player wins or the board is full.
6. The winner is announced and the game ends.

## Rules
